The empirical findings indicate that all stations adjust their prices infrequently. However, there are actually two different mechanisms for making these infrequent price adjustments: the state-dependent rule and the time-dependent rule. Retailers employ both pricing rules depending on the situations, and local market power affects this combination of pricing strategies. Stations with more market power are more likely to adjust prices using the time-dependent rule, while those with less market power are more likely to adjust their prices using the state-dependent rule.</li>
                  <li class="paper" words=""><a href="files/Asymmetries_seonyong.pdf">Revisiting Rockets and Feathers: How Frequency of Data Affects Estimation Results</a> <br>This paper revisits asymmetric price adjustments using daily station-level data from the Korean gasoline market. While recent studies tend to utilize high-frequency data to investigate these adjustments, such an approach can introduce significant biases into estimation results due to the nonlinear relationship between changes in retail prices and variable costs. Specifically, although changes in variable costs occur daily, retailers do not consistently respond to these daily cost variations. This study illustrates how the frequency of data affects estimation results by comparing the outcomes across different data frequencies and highlights the inconsistency of results obtained with daily-level data. Additionally, simulations confirm these findings and emphasize the significance of choosing an appropriate econometric model for accurately describing retailers' pricing behavior.<br> </li>
                  <li class="paper" words=""><a href="files/Preventive_seonyong.pdf">Optimal Preventive Maintenance: Balancing Reliability and Costs in Power Systems</a> <i> with M. Choi, Dae-Wook Kim and Man-Keun Kim</i>  <br>This study addresses the challenge of achieving optimal preventive maintenance within power systems, aiming to strike a harmonious balance between reliability and costs. The primary focus is on unraveling the intricate relationship between preventive maintenance expenditures and the failure rate of essential transmission components, with a specific emphasis on transformers in substations. We contribute to the existing literature by offering two key insights. Firstly, we establish a theoretical foundation for determining the optimal level of preventive maintenance, which can be extended across various electricity facilities. By scrutinizing the relationship between preventive maintenance costs and failure rates, our goal is to identify the investment level that guarantees a dependable power system while minimizing financial burdens. Secondly, we explore the functional form that accurately characterizes the link between preventive maintenance costs and failure rates. The diminishing marginal rate of failure, contingent on various functional
                    forms, highlights the variability of optimal preventive maintenance expenses. Utilizing Lasso regression, we identify the functional form that optimally characterizes the relationship between outage occurrences and maintenance costs. These insights extend well beyond the confines of the Korean power industry, offering a sustainable approach to managing transmission facilities and enhancing the overall stability and effciency of global electricity networks.</li>
